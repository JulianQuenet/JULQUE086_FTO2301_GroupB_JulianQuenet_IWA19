Forming part of the Interactive Web Applications course, this being the final project integrating all concepts learnt.
Purpose of this project is to take previously un-finished and inccorect code and fix it to make the website display and run as intended.
As the name implies this website/webpage is focused on books, allowing the user to search throuhg the available library, filtering by genre, author and title. The user is also able to toggle through light and dark mode as well as preview any book they so wish.
